cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin midi_diagnostic 2

# Test LED functionality
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin led_diagnostic

# Check build information
cargo --version
rustc --version
```

## Common Issues

### MIDI Device Not Detected

```bash
# Check USB connection
system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep -i mikro  # macOS

# List MIDI ports
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin conductor --release

# Check Audio MIDI Setup
open -a "Audio MIDI Setup"  # macOS
```

**Solutions**:
- Verify USB cable connection
- Check device is powered on
- Restart device and computer
- Try different USB port
- Check Audio MIDI Setup (macOS) or ALSA (Linux)

### LEDs Not Working

**Solutions**:
- Ensure Native Instruments drivers installed (for NI devices)
- Grant Input Monitoring permission on macOS:
  - System Settings → Privacy & Security → Input Monitoring
- Try different LED schemes: `--led reactive` or `--led rainbow`
- Check `DEBUG=1` output for HID connection errors
- Verify device supports LED control (check compatibility matrix)

### Events Not Triggering

```bash
# Verify MIDI events are being received
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin midi_diagnostic 2
```

**Solutions**:
- Verify note numbers match your config
- Check velocity/duration thresholds
- Ensure you're in the correct mode (use encoder to switch)
- Check DEBUG=1 output for event processing
- Verify mapping is in active mode or global_mappings

### Permission Errors (macOS)

**Required Permissions**:
- **Input Monitoring**: For HID device access (LED control)
- **Accessibility** (optional): For some keyboard shortcuts

**Grant Permissions**:
1. System Settings → Privacy & Security
2. Input Monitoring → Add Terminal or your IDE
3. Restart application after granting permissions

### Conflicts with Controller Editor

Conductor uses shared device mode (macOS) to allow concurrent access with Native Instruments Controller Editor.

**If issues persist**:
- Quit Controller Editor before running Conductor
- Restart device after switching applications
- Check `DEBUG=1` for HID device access messages

## Performance Issues

Expected performance:
- **Latency**: <1ms typical
- **Memory**: 5-10MB
- **CPU**: <1% idle, <5% active

If experiencing performance issues:
- Close other MIDI applications
- Use release build: `cargo build --release`
- Check system resource usage
- Report performance bugs with profiling data

## Security Issues

**DO NOT report security vulnerabilities publicly.**

For security issues, please follow our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md):
- Email: (Check SECURITY.md for contact)
- Provide detailed information privately
- Allow time for a fix before public disclosure
