# Turn Any Controller Into a Supercharged Macro Pad

**What if every button on your Xbox controller could be a keyboard shortcut? What if tapping a MIDI pad softly did one thing, and hitting it hard did something else?**

Conductor is the missing link between your game controllers, MIDI devices, and your computer. It's open-source, blazingly fast (<1ms latency), and lets you create workflows that expensive macro pads can't touch.

**v3.0 is here**: MIDI + gamepads in one workflow. Use your $30 Xbox controller as a 15-button macro pad, or combine a MIDI controller with a racing wheel for creative hybrid setups.

✨ **The Killer Feature**: Velocity sensitivity. Press soft = copy, press hard = paste. One pad, multiple actions. Mind. Blown.

## What's Possible with Conductor

Transform your creative workflow in ways traditional macro tools can't:

### 🎵 Music Production
- **Velocity-sensitive recording**: Soft press = loop record, hard press = punch record
- **One pad, three actions**: Turn a $30 MIDI controller into a pressure-sensitive control surface
- **Gamepad as DAW navigator**: Use your Xbox controller for timeline navigation while keeping hands on MIDI keyboard

### 💻 Software Development
- **Git workflow on a pad**: Soft = status, medium = commit, hard = commit+push
- **Velocity-based scrolling**: Soft tap = 1 line, hard hit = jump 10 lines
- **Build triggers**: Press A button to build, hold B to run tests

### 🎮 Content Creation
- **Racing wheel for video editing**: Use pedals for effects control, wheel for timeline scrubbing
- **Gamepad for streaming**: 15+ shortcuts at your fingertips without touching keyboard
- **Form automation**: Fill complex forms with one button press

### ⚡ Power Users
- **Repurpose existing hardware**: That dusty Xbox controller? It's now a 15-button macro pad
- **Hot-reload everything**: Change configs on-the-fly, no restart needed (0-10ms reload)
- **Context-aware mappings**: Different actions based on active app, time of day, or system state

## Who is Conductor For?

### 🎹 Music Producers & Live Performers

**You have**: A MIDI controller (Maschine, Launchpad, APC Mini) that's not fully integrated into your workflow, or you're manually switching modes constantly during recording sessions.

**Conductor gives you**: Velocity-sensitive DAW control, per-app profile switching, RGB LED feedback that shows your current state, and hot-reload that lets you tweak mappings mid-session.

**Example workflow**:
> "Soft press on pad 1 = loop record, medium press = one-shot sample, hard press = toggle reverb. One pad, three actions. I don't switch modes anymore—velocity does it for me."

**[See Music Production Examples →](examples/music-production.md)**

---

### 💻 Software Developers & DevOps Engineers

**You have**: Too many terminal windows open, countless keyboard shortcuts to remember, and repetitive git workflows that waste 20-30 minutes daily.

**Conductor gives you**: One-button git operations, build/test triggers mapped to gamepad buttons, and context-aware shortcuts that change based on your active IDE.

**Example workflow**:
> "Press gamepad button A = git status. Hold for 2 seconds = commit and push with auto-generated message. My PlayStation controller saves me 30 minutes every day."

**[See Developer Workflows →](examples/developer-workflows.md)**

---

### 🎮 Streamers & Content Creators

**You have**: A $150-300 Stream Deck on your wishlist, or you're using keyboard shortcuts that break your flow during streams.

**Conductor gives you**: Professional stream controls for free using your existing Xbox/PlayStation controller, with velocity-sensitive audio fading and button chords for complex actions.

**Example workflow**:
> "Xbox A button = switch scene, B = mute mic, triggers = analog audio fade in/out. I saved $300 by repurposing my gamepad instead of buying a Stream Deck."

**[See Streaming Setup Guide →](examples/streaming.md)**

---

### 🎬 Video Editors & Post-Production

**You have**: Keyboard-heavy editing workflows that strain your wrists, and you wish timeline scrubbing felt more natural.

**Conductor gives you**: Analog pedal control for timeline speed and zoom, ergonomic button layouts on MIDI controllers or racing wheels, and hands-free transport control.

**Example workflow**:
> "My racing wheel's gas pedal controls timeline playback speed (0-200%). Brake pedal = zoom level. It sounds crazy, but it's incredibly intuitive and ergonomic."

**[See Video Editing Examples →](examples/video-editing.md)**

---

### ⚡ Power Users & Automation Enthusiasts

**You have**: Repetitive tasks you're sick of doing manually, forms that need filling out dozens of times daily, or app-specific shortcuts you can never remember.

**Conductor gives you**: Context-aware shortcuts that change based on active application, form automation that fills entire forms with one button press, and MIDI Learn that makes configuration visual and instant.

**Example workflow**:
> "I mapped long-press to 'fill entire web form with saved data.' Double-tap = refresh page. Velocity determines scroll speed. Saved hours every week."

**[See Automation Examples →](examples/automation.md)**

---

### 🕹️ Gamers Repurposing Controllers

**You have**: A dusty Xbox controller, old racing wheel, or HOTAS setup that you barely use anymore.

**Conductor gives you**: A second life for your gaming hardware as professional productivity tools. That $150 racing wheel becomes a $300 video editing controller.

**Example workflow**:
> "My Thrustmaster HOTAS from Star Citizen now controls my entire dev environment. 20+ shortcuts without touching the keyboard. Plus, it's just fun to use."
