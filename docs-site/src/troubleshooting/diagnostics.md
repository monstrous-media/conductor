# Diagnostic Tools and Procedures

## Overview

Conductor includes a comprehensive suite of diagnostic tools for debugging connectivity, event processing, LED control, and configuration issues. This guide covers each tool in detail and provides systematic troubleshooting procedures.

## Reporting a bug: Export Diagnostics (start here)

**Conductor tray icon ▸ Export Diagnostics…**

This writes `conductor-diagnostics-<date>.zip` to your Desktop and reveals it in
Finder. Attach that file to your bug report. No terminal required.

The bundle contains your logs, your config and profiles, the daemon's status and
device bindings, your app version and CPU architecture, and any buffered crash
reports. It is **sanitized before it is written**: your home-directory path is
replaced with `<user>`, and API keys, bearer tokens and email addresses are
redacted. It is collected from an explicit allowlist of files, so nothing else in
those folders is picked up.

Nothing is transmitted. Conductor writes a file; you decide who gets it. Unzip it
and read it first if you like.

## Where are the logs?

You do **not** need a terminal, a developer build, or `cargo` to get Conductor's
logs. Both the app and the background daemon write rotating log files:

| Platform | Location |
|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/Logs/Conductor/` |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/conductor/logs/` |

On macOS, open Finder and press **⇧⌘G**, then paste `~/Library/Logs/Conductor`.

| File | What's in it | Rotation |
|---|---|---|
| `gui.<date>.log` | the Conductor app | daily, last 5 kept |
| `daemon.<date>.log` | the background daemon (device I/O, mapping, routing) | daily, last 5 kept |
| `daemon-stdout.log` | anything the daemon printed *before* its logger started, including crashes | append-only, not rotated (stays small — it is not a second copy of the log) |

If you're reporting a bug, attach today's `gui` and `daemon` logs.

To capture more detail, quit Conductor and relaunch it with `DEBUG=1`. This works
on the release build — you do not need a source checkout:

```bash
# the app
DEBUG=1 open -a Conductor

# or the daemon on its own, with output in the terminal
DEBUG=1 /Applications/Conductor.app/Contents/MacOS/conductor
```

`RUST_LOG` still overrides `DEBUG` if you need per-module control, e.g.
`RUST_LOG=conductor_daemon::midi_device=trace`.

The rest of this guide covers the developer diagnostic tools, which need a
source checkout.

## Quick Diagnostic Checklist

Before diving deep, run through this quick checklist:

```bash
# 1. Check USB/MIDI connectivity
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin test_midi

# 2. Verify MIDI events are received
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin midi_diagnostic 2

# 3. Test LED/HID access
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin led_diagnostic

# 4. Find note numbers
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin pad_mapper 2

# 5. Enable debug logging
DEBUG=1 cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin conductor --release 2
```

If all five succeed, the hardware and drivers are working correctly.

## Diagnostic Tool Reference

### 1. test_midi - MIDI Port Testing

**Purpose**: Verify MIDI connectivity, enumerate all available ports, test basic MIDI communication.

**Syntax**:
```bash
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin test_midi
```

**What it does**:
1. Lists all MIDI input ports
2. Lists all MIDI output ports
3. Attempts to open port 2 (default)
4. Waits for a MIDI event (5-second timeout)
5. Reports success or failure

**Expected output** (working):
```
MIDI Port Test
==============

Available input ports:
0: USB MIDI Device
1: IAC Driver Bus 1
2: Maschine Mikro MK3 - Input
3: Digital Keyboard

Available output ports:
0: USB MIDI Device
1: IAC Driver Bus 1
2: Maschine Mikro MK3 - Output

Testing port 2 (input)...
✓ Successfully opened port: Maschine Mikro MK3 - Input

Waiting for MIDI event... (5 second timeout)
✓ Received MIDI event: NoteOn ch:0 note:12 vel:87

Connection test: PASSED
All MIDI functionality working correctly.
```

**Error output** (device not found):
```
Available input ports:
0: IAC Driver Bus 1
# Device missing!

Testing port 2 (input)...
✗ Error: Port index 2 out of range (only 1 ports available)

Connection test: FAILED
```

**Interpreting results**:

- **Device not listed**: USB/driver issue (see [Common Issues - MIDI Device Not Found](common-issues.md#midi-device-not-found))
- **Timeout on event**: Device connected but not sending data
  - Check device is in MIDI mode (not HID-only mode)
  - Verify pads/keys are functional
  - Try different port number
- **"Permission denied"**: User permission issue (Linux)
  - Add user to `audio` or `plugdev` group
  - Check udev rules

**When to use**:
- First step in any MIDI troubleshooting
- After connecting a new device
- After driver installation
- Verifying port numbers before running conductor

### 2. midi_diagnostic - MIDI Event Monitor

**Purpose**: Real-time visualization of all MIDI events for debugging event detection and mapping issues.

**Syntax**:
```bash
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin midi_diagnostic <PORT>

# Example
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin midi_diagnostic 2
```

**What it does**:
- Opens specified MIDI port
- Listens for all MIDI events
- Displays events in human-readable format
- Shows channel, note/cc number, velocity/value
- Runs until Ctrl+C

**Output format**:
```
Connected to MIDI port 2: Maschine Mikro MK3 - Input
Listening for MIDI events... (Ctrl+C to exit)

[16:32:45] [NoteOn]  ch:0 note:12 vel:87
[16:32:45] [NoteOff] ch:0 note:12 vel:0
[16:32:46] [NoteOn]  ch:0 note:13 vel:64
[16:32:46] [NoteOff] ch:0 note:13 vel:0
[16:32:47] [CC]      ch:0 cc:1 value:64
[16:32:48] [PitchBend] ch:0 value:8192
[16:32:49] [Aftertouch] ch:0 note:12 pressure:48
```

**Event types shown**:

- **NoteOn**: Note pressed
  - `ch`: MIDI channel (0-15)
  - `note`: Note number (0-127)
  - `vel`: Velocity (0-127)

- **NoteOff**: Note released
  - `vel` is usually 0, some devices use release velocity

- **CC** (Control Change): Knob, slider, encoder
  - `cc`: Controller number (0-127)
  - `value`: Value (0-127)

- **PitchBend**: Touch strip, pitch wheel
  - `value`: Bend amount (0-16383, center=8192)

- **Aftertouch**: Pressure sensitivity
  - `note`: Which note (if polyphonic)
  - `pressure`: Pressure value (0-127)

- **ProgramChange**: Program/patch change
  - `program`: Program number (0-127)

**Use cases**:

1. **Verify MIDI events are being sent**:
   ```bash
   cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin midi_diagnostic 2
   # Press pads - you should see NoteOn/NoteOff events
   ```

2. **Find note numbers for config**:
   ```bash
   cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin midi_diagnostic 2
   # Press pad → note:12 → use 12 in config.toml
   ```

3. **Debug why mappings aren't triggering**:
   ```bash
   # Compare MIDI diagnostic output with config.toml
   # If you see note:25 but config has note:12, they don't match
   ```

4. **Verify velocity ranges**:
   ```bash
   cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin midi_diagnostic 2
   # Soft tap:  vel:32  (0-40 range)
   # Medium:    vel:68  (41-80 range)
   # Hard hit:  vel:105 (81-127 range)
   ```

5. **Check encoder/knob CC numbers**:
   ```bash
   cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin midi_diagnostic 2
   # Turn encoder → [CC] ch:0 cc:1 value:65
   # Use cc:1 in EncoderTurn trigger
   ```

**Troubleshooting with midi_diagnostic**:

**Problem**: No events appear when pressing pads

**Solutions**:
- Wrong port number (try 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Device not sending MIDI (check device settings)
- USB cable issue (try different cable)
- Driver issue (reinstall drivers)

**Problem**: Wrong note numbers appearing

**Cause**: Device is on different pad page or has custom profile

**Solution**: Either:
- Change device to expected page
- Update config.toml with actual note numbers
- Use `--profile` flag with correct profile

**Problem**: Events appear but with unexpected values

**Example**: Expecting ch:0 but seeing ch:1

**Solution**: Update trigger channel in config:
```toml
[trigger]
type = "Note"
note = 12
channel = 1  # Add channel specification
```

### 3. led_diagnostic - LED/HID Testing

**Purpose**: Test LED control and HID device access for troubleshooting lighting issues.

**Syntax**:
```bash
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin led_diagnostic
```

**What it does**:
1. Searches for HID device (Maschine Mikro MK3)
2. Attempts to open HID device
3. Tests LED control by cycling through all pads
4. Displays each step's success/failure

**Expected output** (working):
```

```

**Interpreting results**:

- **Device found, opened, LEDs working**: All HID/LED functionality OK
- **Device found but won't open**: Permission or driver issue
- **Device not found**: USB/hardware issue
- **Opens but LEDs don't light**: Coordinate mapping or hardware issue

**When to use**:
- LEDs not working in main application
- After granting Input Monitoring permission (verify it worked)
- After installing NI drivers (verify driver installation)
- Testing LED hardware functionality
- Before reporting LED bugs

### 4. led_tester - Interactive LED Control

**Purpose**: Manual control of individual LEDs for testing coordinate mapping and hardware.

**Syntax**:
```bash
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin led_tester
```

**Interactive mode**:
```

Physical Layout (bottom-up):
12  13  14  15  <- Top row
 8   9  10  11
 4   5   6   7
 0   1   2   3  <- Bottom row

LED Buffer (top-down):
 0   1   2   3  <- Top (buffer 0-3)
 4   5   6   7
 8   9  10  11
12  13  14  15  <- Bottom (buffer 12-15)

Mapping Table:
  Pad  0 -> LED 12    Pad  8 -> LED  4
  Pad  1 -> LED 13    Pad  9 -> LED  5
  Pad  2 -> LED 14    Pad 10 -> LED  6
  Pad  3 -> LED 15    Pad 11 -> LED  7
  Pad  4 -> LED  8    Pad 12 -> LED  0
  Pad  5 -> LED  9    Pad 13 -> LED  1
  Pad  6 -> LED 10    Pad 14 -> LED  2
  Pad  7 -> LED 11    Pad 15 -> LED  3

> clear
✓ All LEDs cleared

> quit
Goodbye!
```

**Use cases**:

1. **Test individual pad LEDs**:
   ```
   > on 0 white 3
   # Bottom-left pad should light up bright white
   ```

2. **Verify coordinate mapping**:
   ```
   > coords
   # Shows physical layout vs LED buffer
   > on 0 red 3
   # Verify bottom-left pad lights (should be LED buffer position 12)
   ```

3. **Test all colors**:
   ```
   > on 0 red 3
   > on 1 orange 3
   > on 2 yellow 3
   > on 3 green 3
   > on 4 blue 3
   > on 5 purple 3
   ```

4. **Brightness testing**:
   ```
   > on 0 white 0   # Off
   > on 0 white 1   # Dim
   > on 0 white 2   # Normal
   > on 0 white 3   # Bright
   ```

**When to use**:
- Debugging coordinate mapping issues
- Testing specific pad LEDs (identify dead LEDs)
- Understanding LED coordinate system
- Verifying color/brightness encoding

### 5. pad_mapper - Note Number Discovery

**Purpose**: Identify MIDI note numbers for physical pads to use in config.toml.

**Syntax**:
```bash
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin pad_mapper <PORT>

# Example
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin pad_mapper 2
```

**What it does**:
- Opens MIDI port
- Listens for NoteOn events
- Displays note number and velocity for each press
- Continues until Ctrl+C

**Output**:
```
Pad Mapper - Find Note Numbers for Your Controller
===================================================
Connected to port 2: Maschine Mikro MK3 - Input

Press pads in order (bottom-left to top-right) and write down note numbers.
Ctrl+C to exit when done.

Pad pressed: Note 12 (velocity: 87)
Pad pressed: Note 13 (velocity: 64)
Pad pressed: Note 14 (velocity: 92)
Pad pressed: Note 15 (velocity: 73)
Pad pressed: Note 8  (velocity: 55)
Pad pressed: Note 9  (velocity: 81)
[continues as you press pads...]
```

**Recommended workflow**:

1. **Run pad_mapper**:
   ```bash
   cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin pad_mapper 2
   ```

2. **Draw a grid** on paper:
   ```
   [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]  <- Top row
   [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
   [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
   [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]  <- Bottom row
   ```

3. **Press each pad** starting bottom-left, moving right:
   - Press bottom-left → write down note number (e.g., 12)
   - Press next pad right → write down note number (e.g., 13)
   - Continue for all 16 pads

4. **Result**:
   ```
   [12][13][14][15]  <- Top row
   [ 8][ 9][10][11]
   [ 4][ 5][ 6][ 7]
   [ 0][ 1][ 2][ 3]  <- Bottom row
   ```

   Wait, those look wrong! That's because your device might be on a different page or have a custom profile. The numbers you write down are the ones to use in config.toml.

5. **Update config.toml** with actual note numbers:
   ```toml
   [[modes.mappings]]
   description = "Bottom-left pad"
   [modes.mappings.trigger]
   type = "Note"
   note = 0  # Or whatever number you wrote down
   ```

**Use cases**:
- Initial setup of a new device
- Creating config.toml for the first time
- Verifying note numbers after changing device profile
- Debugging why specific pads don't work

**Tips**:
- Press pads gently and consistently (velocity affects detection)
- Write down numbers immediately (easy to forget)
- Take a photo of your paper grid for reference
- Some controllers send different notes on different "pages" or "banks"

## Advanced Debugging with DEBUG=1

Enable verbose debug logging to see internal event processing:

**Syntax**:
```bash
DEBUG=1 cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin conductor --release 2
```

### Debug Output Format

**MIDI Events**:
```
[16:32:45.123] [MIDI] NoteOn ch:0 note:12 vel:87
[16:32:45.124] [MIDI] NoteOff ch:0 note:12 vel:0
```

**Event Processing**:
```
[DEBUG] Processing NoteOn: note=12 vel=87
[DEBUG] Detected velocity range: Medium (41-80)
[DEBUG] Stored note 12 in press tracker (time: 16:32:45.123)
```

**Mapping Engine**:
```
[DEBUG] Checking 24 mappings in mode 'Default'
[DEBUG] Matched mapping: "Copy text" (trigger: Note(12))
[DEBUG] Compiled action: Keystroke { keys: "c", modifiers: ["cmd"] }
```

**Action Execution**:
```
[DEBUG] Executing Keystroke action
[DEBUG] Pressing key: C
[DEBUG] Holding modifiers: [Cmd]
[DEBUG] Releasing key: C
✓ Action executed successfully (1.2ms)
```

**LED Updates**:
```
[DEBUG] LED update request: pad=0 color=Green brightness=2
[DEBUG] Mapped pad 0 -> LED position 12
[DEBUG] HID buffer: [80 00 00 ... 1D ... 00] (81 bytes)
[DEBUG] HID write successful (4 bytes written)
```

**Mode Changes**:
```
[DEBUG] Mode change requested: next
[DEBUG] Current mode: 0 (Default)
[DEBUG] Switching to mode: 1 (Developer)
[INFO] Mode changed: Default -> Developer
```

**Timers and State**:
```
[DEBUG] Long press timer started: note=12 threshold=2000ms
[DEBUG] Note released after 1523ms (threshold: 2000ms)
[DEBUG] Long press NOT triggered (held too short)
```

```
[DEBUG] Double-tap window started: note=12 timeout=300ms
[DEBUG] Second tap detected within 287ms
[DEBUG] Double-tap triggered: note=12
```

```
[DEBUG] Chord detection: notes=[12, 13, 14] timeout=100ms
[DEBUG] All notes pressed within 47ms
[DEBUG] Chord triggered: [12, 13, 14]
```

### Interpreting Debug Output

#### Problem: Mapping not triggering

**Look for**:
```
[DEBUG] No mapping matched for event: Note(12)
```

**Possible causes**:
- Note number mismatch (check pad_mapper output)
- Wrong mode (check current mode in debug output)
- Trigger conditions not met (velocity, timing)

**Solution**: Compare debug output with config.toml

---

#### Problem: Action not executing

**Look for**:
```
[DEBUG] Matched mapping: "Test"
[ERROR] Failed to execute action: Command not found
```

**Cause**: Action configuration error (e.g., invalid shell command)

**Solution**: Fix action in config.toml

---

#### Problem: LEDs not updating

**Look for**:
```
[DEBUG] LED update request: pad=0
[ERROR] HID write failed: Device not open
```

**Cause**: HID device not accessible

**Solution**: Check permissions, run led_diagnostic

---

## USB Connection Verification

### macOS

**Check USB device enumeration**:
```bash
# List all USB devices
system_profiler SPUSBDataType

# Filter for your device
system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep -i mikro

# More detailed output
system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep -B 10 -A 10 "Mikro"
```

**Expected output**:
```
Maschine Mikro MK3:
  Product ID: 0x1600
  Vendor ID: 0x17cc  (Native Instruments)
  Version: 1.00
  Serial Number: XXXXXXXX
  Speed: Up to 12 Mb/s
  Manufacturer: Native Instruments
  Location ID: 0x14200000 / 5
  Current Available (mA): 500
  Current Required (mA): 100
  Extra Operating Current (mA): 0
```

**Check for device disappearance**:
```bash
# Monitor USB devices
log stream --predicate 'eventMessage contains "USB"' --level info
```

Then plug/unplug device - you should see connection events.

### Linux

**Check USB devices**:
```bash
# List USB devices
lsusb

# Filter for Native Instruments (VID: 17cc)
lsusb | grep 17cc

# Detailed info
lsusb -v -d 17cc:1600
```

**Check dmesg for USB events**:
```bash
# Show recent USB events
dmesg | grep -i usb | tail -20

# Monitor in real-time
dmesg -w | grep -i usb
```

**Check ALSA MIDI**:
```bash
# List ALSA MIDI devices
aconnect -l

# Or
amidi -l
```

### Windows

**Device Manager**:
1. Open Device Manager (Win+X → Device Manager)
2. Expand "Sound, video and game controllers"
3. Look for your MIDI device
4. Right-click → Properties → Check status

**Check MIDI devices via PowerShell**:
```powershell
Get-PnpDevice -Class MEDIA | Format-Table -AutoSize
```

## Interpreting Error Messages

### Common Error Patterns

#### "No MIDI input ports available"

**Meaning**: No MIDI devices detected at all

**Debug steps**:
1. `system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep -i usb`
2. `cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin test_midi`
3. Check USB connection
4. Verify drivers installed

---

#### "Failed to open HID device"

**Meaning**: Device found but can't access HID interface

**Debug steps**:
1. Check permissions (Input Monitoring on macOS)
2. `cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin led_diagnostic`
3. Close other applications using device
4. Reinstall NI drivers

---

#### "TOML parse error at line X"

**Meaning**: Syntax error in config.toml

**Debug steps**:
1. Open config.toml in editor
2. Go to line X
3. Check for:
   - Missing quotes
   - Wrong brackets
   - Typos in field names
4. Validate at https://www.toml-lint.com/

---

#### "Missing field 'type' in trigger"

**Meaning**: Invalid config structure

**Debug steps**:
1. Find the mapping missing `type`
2. Add `type` field:
   ```toml
   [trigger]
   type = "Note"  # Add this
   note = 12
   ```

---

#### "Permission denied (os error 13)"

**Meaning**: Insufficient permissions

**macOS**: Grant Input Monitoring permission

**Linux**: Add user to `plugdev` group and create udev rules

**Windows**: Run as Administrator (not recommended for regular use)

---

## Systematic Troubleshooting Procedure

When something doesn't work, follow this systematic approach:

### Level 1: Hardware Connectivity

```bash
# 1. Check USB enumeration
system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep -i mikro

# 2. Test MIDI ports
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin test_midi

# 3. Monitor MIDI events
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin midi_diagnostic 2
```

**If Level 1 fails**: Hardware or driver issue (see [Common Issues](common-issues.md))

### Level 2: Software Connectivity

```bash
# 4. Test HID access
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin led_diagnostic

# 5. Find note numbers
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin pad_mapper 2

# 6. Run with debug logging
DEBUG=1 cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin conductor --release 2
```

**If Level 2 fails**: Permission or configuration issue

### Level 3: Configuration Validation

```bash
# 7. Validate config syntax
cargo check

# 8. Test with minimal config
cat > test.toml << 'EOF'
[[modes]]
name = "Test"
[[modes.mappings]]
description = "Test"
[modes.mappings.trigger]
type = "Note"
note = 0
[modes.mappings.action]
type = "Shell"
command = "say test"
EOF

cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin conductor --release 2 --config test.toml

# 9. Compare note numbers
# pad_mapper output vs config.toml
```

**If Level 3 fails**: Config syntax or mapping issue

### Level 4: Deep Debugging

```bash
# 10. Enable trace-level logging
RUST_LOG=trace cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin conductor --release 2

# 11. Check for resource exhaustion
# Activity Monitor (macOS) / Task Manager (Windows)

# 12. Test on different computer
# (isolates hardware vs software issues)
```

## Performance Profiling

### Response Time Analysis

```bash
DEBUG=1 cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin conductor --release 2 2>&1 | grep -E 'NoteOn|executed'
```

**Measure latency**:
```
[16:32:45.123456] NoteOn
[16:32:45.124789] Action executed (1.3ms)
```

Latency = 1.3ms (excellent, <5ms is good)

### CPU Usage Monitoring

**macOS**:
```bash
# Monitor CPU in real-time
top | grep conductor

# Or use Activity Monitor GUI
open -a "Activity Monitor"
```

**Expected CPU usage**:

### Redirecting Output

**Save all output**:
```bash
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin conductor --release 2 > conductor.log 2>&1
```

**Save only errors**:
```bash
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin conductor --release 2 2> conductor.err
```

**Separate stdout and stderr**:
```bash
cargo run -p conductor-daemon --bin conductor --release 2 > conductor.out 2> conductor.err
```

### Analyzing Logs

**Count events**:
```bash
grep -c "NoteOn" conductor.log
```

**Find errors**:
```bash
grep -i error conductor.log
grep -i failed conductor.log
```

**Extract timings**:
```bash
grep "Action executed" conductor.log | sed 's/.*(\(.*\)ms).*/\1/'
```
